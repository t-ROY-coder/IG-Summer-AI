CNN can used where there is more data to be precessed since it's already using the GPU and also where the knowledge of the features is a bot unknown.
Random Forests can be used where the user has more knowledge about the data.

CNN may have an overfitting problem since it uses only one good model.
Random Forests, on the other hand, use different models and that's why they have a less tendency of overfitting.
